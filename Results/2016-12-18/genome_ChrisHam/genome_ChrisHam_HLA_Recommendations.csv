239,239,HLA_DPB1_0401,,"The frequency of the *04:01 allele was 28.8% in those with aspirin-induced asthma, as compared to 49.0% in normal controls and 45.6% in asthmatic controls. This difference withstood correction for multiple testing, but only when comparing aspirin-induced asthmatics with normal controls.",HLA-DPB1 *04:01:01:01 is associated with decreased risk of aspirin-induced asthma.,*04:01:01:01
245,245,HLA_DPB1_0401,clozapine (PA449061),The HLA-DPB*04:01 allele was more frequent in patients with clozapine-induced agranulocytosis as compared to clozapine-tolerant controls.,HLA-DPB1 *04:01:01:01 is associated with increased risk of Agranulocytosis when treated with clozapine in people with Schizophrenia.,*04:01:01:01
275,275,HLA_DQB1_0302,nevirapine (PA450616),"The *03:02:01 allele was associated with a decreased risk for developing hypersensitivity reactions on nevirapine, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), drug-induced liver injury (DILI) or hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), when compared against the baseline ""rare allele"" group.",HLA-DQB1 *03:02:01 is associated with decreased risk of Drug Hypersensitivity when treated with nevirapine in people with HIV.,*03:02:01
277,277,HLA_DQB1_0302,nevirapine (PA450616),"The *03:02:01 allele was associated with a decreased risk for developing drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS, also known as hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS)), when compared against the baseline ""rare allele"" group.",HLA-DQB1 *03:02:01 is associated with decreased risk of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms when treated with nevirapine in people with HIV.,*03:02:01
383,383,HLA_DQB1_0301,clozapine (PA449061),"No significant association was seen between the presence of the HLA-DQ3 serotype and likelihood of experiencing clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, either in an exclusively Ashkenazi Jewish cohort (n=22) or in a Jewish and non-Jewish overall cohort (n=31). Note that this annotation was completed on HLA-DQB1*03:01:01:01 because the DQ3 serotype recognizes HLA-DQB1*03 alleles, and *03:01:01:01 was the first *03 allele discovered. However, the haplotype HLA-B38, HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ3 was also significantly associated with an increased risk for agranulocytosis (see annotation on HLA-B*38:01:01 above). p-value for significance was set at 0.005.",HLA-DQB1 *03:01:01:01 is not associated with risk of Agranulocytosis when treated with clozapine in people with schizoaffective disorder or Schizophrenia.,*03:01:01:01
